hi, i would like some help, making this mess better.
sorry, that i could not do it on my own.

choose something you care about and share how the systems dont let you express this.

for example:
I want to respect you, but when i contribute to our finance or political systems, this information is lost.
Thus i contribute to systems which dont respect you.


kapitalism("i would not by this shit if it would make a difference when i dont bye it") => "give me more of this shit"


i believe that requiring someone to do the work themself and alone to get paid is very bad if you want to let the person share there learning
